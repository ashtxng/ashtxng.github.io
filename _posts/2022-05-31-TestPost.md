Hi I'm Isaac a young coder who likes tinkering with code and stuff. I've made a couple random projects in my time. You can check them out on my [projects page](/projects/).

If you want to follow me on places then you go to [tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@isaacdoescodes) or, if you code aswell, on [github](https://github.com/isaacdoescodes). I'm only allowed tiktok and github because that's all my parents will let me but I may be getting twitter and/or instagram soon (maybe).

## What I have done

Nothing :\ (important anyway)

## What I like doing

- Coding
- Playing Games

## What I _can_ use

- Use HTML, CSS, JS, Jekyll, Sass (sort-of), Python, PHP
