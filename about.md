Hello there! I'm Isaac, a young computer nerd from England. I haven't really made anything useful but I might do when school is not a problem. I've made a few small things though. You can check them out on my [projects page](/projects). 

I live in a small village on the outskirts of a really boring town called Swindon. Like it has a shopping center and… well… nothing else. Luckily it's not too far from Bristol and London.

Although this website is mainly focused on coding I like a few other things. Trains are cool and I'm also learning piano.

I'm mainly skilled in (Technical Jargon Alert) HTML, CSS and JS. This website is created using the Jekyll tooling and Sass. I know a little in Electron.js and Node. And I'm considering learning Swift and TypeScript. 

Ok that's it, you can explore the rest of the website now.
